CTF operates four printers for student use in Burnside basement, one in the hallway outside room 1B19 and one in each of rooms 1B18, 1B17 and 1B16. There are also printers located in several other buildings (more on that to come). We are currently in the midst of upgrading our printing services, so there is only one working printer at the moment, located on the right side of lab 1B17. You must use a computer in that lab itself in order to print to it.

Who can print?
--------------

Students in the faculties of Science or Arts and Science can use the printers as part of the student fees that they pay.

Quota
-----

Each black-and-white page costs four credits. If a print job causes you to exceed your quota, the job will still proceed, but you won't be able to print anything else. For the time being, every user starts with 1500 credits (375 pages) which cannot be topped-up and which can only be used for the printer in 1B17 (printer name "1B17-Right"). This is a temporary measure while we upgrade our printing services.

Note that that the cost of printing is four credits _per page_, meaning that printing a double-sided sheet of paper costs 8 credits.
