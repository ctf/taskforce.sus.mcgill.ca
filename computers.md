CTF operates over 60 computers for use by McGill students, located throughout Burnside basement and at remote stations in Duff, Maass, Rutherford, and Stewart Biology. Most of the computers in Burnside can be found in our dedicated computer labs (rooms 1B16, 1B17 and 1B18). Additional computers are outside the computer labs in the main thoroughfare. Note that this page is still under construction&mdash;please check frequently for updates.

Using the printers
------------------

See [Printing](printing.html).

Who can use them?
-----------------

All McGill students can use our computers, but some restrictions apply to non-Science or Arts & Science students. Science and Arts & Science students contribute directly to the SUS 21st Century Fund. Students from other faculties (including Nursing, Agricultural Sciences, and Kinesiology) can open an account with us for $30, which includes 1500 [printing credits](printing.html). The $30 fee also grants access to the computer labs and Burnside Hall after hours, upon request. The fee must be repaid each semester to maintain access.

Logging in
----------

Your login credentials are your [McGill Username and McGill Password](http://kb.mcgill.ca/it/easylink/article.html?id=1006). To change your password, please see [the McGill IT Knowledgebase](http://kb.mcgill.ca/it/easylink/article.html?id=1025). If you've tried to log onto one of our computers several times unsuccessfully, your account may be locked by McGill IT Services. If this is the case, you will need to [contact the ICS Service Desk](http://kb.mcgill.ca/it/easylink/article.html?id=1797).

Storage space
-------------

All of our computers provide access to two shared network drives on which students can save personal documents: the campus-wide `P:` drive, and the `M:` drive, which is hosted by us. On top of the 100 MB provided by McGill to all students, our users receive 150 MB on the `M:` drive. If you run out of storage space, you may find programs starting to behave erratically; in that case, you should try deleting old or unused files.

Installed programs
------------------

Our computers have the following supported software installed for all Science students:

* Firefox, Google Chrome, and Internet Explorer
* Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote)
* Notepad++, Eclipse and Geany
* PuTTY and WinSCP
* Pidgin (an instant messaging client)
* MiKTeX, TeXnicCentre, and LyX

Other software is installed as well&mdash;you can find a list of installed programs using the Start menu. Users may not install software on our computers. If you have a piece of software you would like to run, you may try a portable version run from a USB stick. We are always looking to improve our software selection. If you have a recommendation, let us know by [email or in person](contact.html) and we will consider installing it on our computers.

System information
------------------

We are currently in the middle of a deployment of brand-new, powerful computers to the Burnside basement and remote stations. We anticipate a complete overhaul by the end of the school year.

Here are the specifications of the currently deployed Dell Optiplex 990s:

* Intel i5 3.1 GHz CPU
* 4 GB RAM
* 1 GB Radeon HD 6670 video card

* Windows 7 Professional
* Widescreen 23&quot; monitors

Locations
---------

At present, we are mainly located in Burnside basement, with 14 computers in the hallway, 24 computers in each of 1B16 and 1B17, and 12 computers in 1B18. Additional remote stations of between 6 and 14 computers can be found in:

* Duff Microbiology,
* Maass Chemistry,
* Rutherford Physics, and
* Stewart Biology.

Computer lab rules
------------------

No food or drinks are allowed in the computer labs. Offenders will find themselves locked out of CTF computers for one week. We ask you to be courteous to other students in the labs and treat our equipment gently.

Computer lab hours
------------------

Students in the Faculty of Science have 24/7 card access to Burnside and our computer labs. For out-of-faculty students, the computer labs are only unlocked between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday-Friday. Students with no card access will only be able to access the computer labs between those times. Burnside itself is open to the public between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m, Monday-Friday (excluding holidays).

Computer problems

If you're having problems with your computer, come by the office and we'll try to send someone to take a look at it for you. If you're at a remote station, please [send us an email](contact.html) describing your problem.
