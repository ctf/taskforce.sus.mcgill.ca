You can also send an email to our mailing list at <taskforce@sus.mcgill.ca> or call our office at (514) 398-5843.

If you have a specific support issue, send an email to <support@sus.mcgill.ca> detailing your problem and a support ticket will be automatically created for you. We will then review your ticket and get back to you as soon as possible.
