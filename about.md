> "To provide campus wide information technology, innovations, and user support to enhance Science students' learning experience at McGill University."

CTF, a standing committee of the [Science Undergraduate Society](http://sus.mcgill.ca), was created in 1996 by McGill science students. At the time, our inventory consisted of only three computers in Burnside basement called &ldquo;InfoPoints&rdquo;. Now, we manage a network of over 60 computers and several printers, most of which are located in Burnside basement. We additionally operate remote locations in Duff, Maass, Rutherford, and Stewart Biology. All of our computers are freely available for use by McGill students, although non-Science students face some restrictions. In addition, students in the Faculties of Science and Arts & Science receive free printing credits each semester&mdash;see [Printing](printing.html) for more information.

CTF is the only volunteer organization on campus that operates from 9 to 5, Monday through Friday (except during holidays and the summer semester). We are staffed entirely by student volunteers and receive funding from the SUS 21st Century Computer Fund, paid for by all students in Science and Arts & Science.

If you want to get involved, simply drop in on our meetings every {{ site.meeting_day }} at {{ site.meeting_time }}. Being a member requires attending our weekly meetings at least twice a month, following the Taskforce mailing list, and completing at least three office hours a week. During office hours, you will be expected to fix printers, help students and work on CTF-related projects.
