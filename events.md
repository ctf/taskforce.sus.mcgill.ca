The premier LAN tournament hosted by your Computer Taskforce is back! Each year, CTF hosts LANimal, a gaming event where all proceeds go to charity. Last year's charity was the [Montreal Children's Hospital](http://www.thechildren.com/en/), and this year's is [Charity Water](http://www.charitywater.org/). Food will be provided to all attendees, and there will be prizes for the top contestants.
